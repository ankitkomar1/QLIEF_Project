# QLIEF: Quantum-Lattice Integrated Encryption Framework

This project simulates a hybrid encryption system that integrates Lattice-based Cryptography and Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for quantum-resilient cloud encryption.

## Project Structure

- `dataset/`: Contains the synthetic data for testing.
- `src/`: Includes Python scripts for QKD simulation, lattice key generation, encryption, and adaptive mode switching.
- `README.md`: Project overview and setup guide.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
2. Run the `qlief_simulation.py` inside `src/` to start the simulation.
